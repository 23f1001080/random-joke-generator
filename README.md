# Random Joke Generator

A simple and fun web application that fetches a random joke from the [Official Joke API](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/) and displays it.

## Features

-   **Get Jokes on Demand:** Click a button to get a new random joke.
-   **Loading State:** Shows a "Fetching..." message while waiting for the API response.
-   **Delayed Punchline:** The joke's setup is displayed first, and the punchline is revealed after a 3-second delay for comedic timing.
-   **Clean UI:** A simple, centered, card-based design.
-   **Self-Contained:** All code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is in a single `index.html` file.

## How to Use

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3.  Click the "Get a New Joke" button!
